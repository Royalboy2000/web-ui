# Network Error Analysis

## üîç **Error Summary**

The user is experiencing network errors that prevent the attack launch functionality from working:

### **Primary Errors:**
1. **CORS Error**: `Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://sr-client-cfg.amplitude.com/config`
2. **Enhanced Tracking Protection**: `The resource at "<URL>" was blocked because Enhanced Tracking Protection is enabled`
3. **Amplitude Logger Error**: `Failed to fetch remote configuration because of error: Error: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource`
4. **Attack Launch Error**: `Error launching attack / reading stream: TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource`

## üéØ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **External Dependencies Issue:**
- The application is trying to load external analytics/tracking scripts (Amplitude)
- These external requests are being blocked by browser security features
- The blocking of external resources is affecting the main application functionality

### **CORS Configuration:**
- While we added CORS headers to our Flask app, the issue is with external third-party requests
- The application should not depend on external analytics for core functionality

### **Network Request Failures:**
- The attack launch functionality is failing due to network errors
- This suggests the SSE (Server-Sent Events) stream is not working properly

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Strategy**

### **1. Remove External Dependencies**
- Remove or make optional all external analytics/tracking scripts
- Ensure core functionality works without external resources

### **2. Fix SSE Stream Issues**
- Check the `/test_credentials_stream` endpoint
- Ensure proper CORS headers for SSE
- Add error handling for network failures

### **3. Improve Error Handling**
- Add fallback mechanisms when external resources fail
- Prevent external resource failures from affecting core functionality

### **4. Test in Isolated Environment**
- Verify functionality works without external dependencies
- Test with various browser security settings

## üìã **Action Items**

1. **Immediate**: Remove external analytics dependencies
2. **Fix**: SSE stream endpoint and CORS configuration
3. **Enhance**: Error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Test**: Attack launch functionality in isolation
