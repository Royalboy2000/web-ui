- Task: Modify `stryker_complete_app.html` to show a fake attack demonstration.
- Trigger: Clicking the "Launch Attack" button.
- Action:
  - DO NOT show an alert.
  - Show a new "Live Monitoring" page, NOT on the dashboard.
  - The new page must contain a live feed of the attack.
- Live Feed Details:
  - Simulate exactly 10 fake accounts being tested.
  - The feed must be well-organized with enough information.
  - Columns should include: #, Timestamp, Username, Password (redacted), Status, HTTP Code, Length, Details button.
  - Include metric cards for: Total Attempts, Hits, Elapsed Time, ETA.
  - Include a modal that opens when the "Details" button is clicked, showing more info.
- Styling:
  - The new page and components must match the existing advanced UI style of `stryker_complete_app.html`.
- Bug to fix:
  - The JavaScript error `TypeError: can't access property "classList", document.querySelector(...) is null` must be fixed by adding a hidden nav link and making the `showPage` function robust.
