STRYKER WEB UI - CRITICAL FIXES TODO LIST
==========================================

PRIORITY 1: RACE CONDITION FIXES
---------------------------------
[ ] Fix file upload dialog appearing during attack execution
    - Issue: Upload dialog shows while attack is running (1184/4984 attempts)
    - Root cause: JavaScript timing issue with modal/dialog display
    - Solution: Add proper state management to prevent upload during active attacks
    - Files to modify: static/script.js, static/new_upload_interface.js

[ ] Implement proper attack state management
    - Add global attack state variable (IDLE, RUNNING, PAUSED, COMPLETED)
    - Disable all upload functionality during RUNNING state
    - Show appropriate status messages during different states
    - Files to modify: static/script.js

[ ] Fix modal/dialog z-index and timing issues
    - Ensure upload dialog only appears when appropriate
    - Add proper modal dismissal when attack starts
    - Implement proper event listeners for state changes
    - Files to modify: static/script.js, templates/index.html

PRIORITY 2: FILE UPLOAD INTERFACE FIXES
----------------------------------------
[ ] Move file upload to Step 3 (Credentials section)
    - Currently appears at wrong time during attack
    - Should be visible in credentials configuration step
    - Add proper integration with existing credential input methods
    - Files to modify: templates/index.html, static/script.js

[ ] Implement proper file upload UI integration
    - Add file upload button/area in credentials section
    - Show file name and credential count after upload
    - Provide clear feedback on upload success/failure
    - Allow switching between manual entry and file upload
    - Files to modify: templates/index.html, static/script.js

[ ] Fix server-side file upload endpoint integration
    - Ensure /upload_credentials endpoint is properly connected
    - Add proper error handling for file upload failures
    - Implement progress feedback for large file uploads
    - Files to modify: app.py, static/script.js

PRIORITY 3: USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------------------
[ ] Add proper loading states and feedback
    - Show upload progress for large files
    - Display credential parsing status
    - Add clear success/error messages
    - Files to modify: static/script.js, templates/index.html

[ ] Implement credential preview functionality
    - Show first 5-10 credentials after file upload
    - Display total credential count
    - Allow user to verify parsing was successful
    - Files to modify: static/script.js

[ ] Add file format validation
    - Check file extensions (.txt, .csv, etc.)
    - Validate file size limits
    - Provide clear error messages for unsupported formats
    - Files to modify: static/script.js, app.py

PRIORITY 4: ATTACK EXECUTION IMPROVEMENTS
------------------------------------------
[ ] Fix attack progress display race condition
    - Ensure progress updates don't interfere with upload dialogs
    - Add proper synchronization between UI components
    - Files to modify: static/script.js

[ ] Implement proper attack cancellation
    - Add cancel button that works reliably
    - Ensure UI returns to proper state after cancellation
    - Clean up any pending upload dialogs
    - Files to modify: static/script.js, app.py

[ ] Add attack pause/resume functionality
    - Allow users to pause long-running attacks
    - Maintain state during pause
    - Resume from correct position
    - Files to modify: static/script.js, app.py

PRIORITY 5: CODE CLEANUP AND OPTIMIZATION
------------------------------------------
[ ] Remove duplicate upload interface code
    - Consolidate multiple upload implementations
    - Remove unused JavaScript functions
    - Clean up event listeners
    - Files to modify: static/script.js, static/new_upload_interface.js

[ ] Optimize large file processing
    - Improve memory usage for 5000+ credential files
    - Add streaming file processing
    - Implement better error recovery
    - Files to modify: app.py, server_side_upload.py

[ ] Add comprehensive error logging
    - Log all upload attempts and failures
    - Add debugging information for race conditions
    - Implement proper error reporting to user
    - Files to modify: app.py, static/script.js

TESTING CHECKLIST
------------------
[ ] Test file upload in Step 3 (before attack starts)
[ ] Test attack execution without upload dialog interference
[ ] Test large file uploads (5000+ credentials)
[ ] Test attack cancellation and UI state reset
[ ] Test multiple file uploads in same session
[ ] Test error handling for corrupted/invalid files
[ ] Test browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
[ ] Test mobile responsiveness

DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
---------------------
[ ] Update requirements.txt with any new dependencies
[ ] Test deployment on clean environment
[ ] Verify all static files are included
[ ] Test production deployment
[ ] Update documentation with new features

CRITICAL BUGS TO FIX IMMEDIATELY
---------------------------------
1. Upload dialog appearing during attack (race condition)
2. File upload not available in credentials step
3. Attack progress interfering with upload UI
4. Missing proper state management
5. Inconsistent UI behavior during file operations

ESTIMATED EFFORT
----------------
Priority 1 fixes: 2-3 hours
Priority 2 fixes: 3-4 hours  
Priority 3 fixes: 2-3 hours
Priority 4 fixes: 2-3 hours
Priority 5 fixes: 1-2 hours
Testing: 2-3 hours
Total: 12-18 hours

NOTES
-----
- Focus on Priority 1 and 2 first - these are critical user experience issues
- The race condition is the most serious problem affecting usability
- File upload should be seamlessly integrated into the normal workflow
- All fixes should maintain backward compatibility with existing features
