# 2FA Detection Research - OWASP Guidelines

## Key Findings from OWASP MFA Testing Guide

### Proper 2FA Detection Indicators

1. **Multi-step Authentication Process**
   - First step: Username/password authentication
   - Second step: Additional factor (OTP, SMS, etc.)
   - Look for actual page transitions or form changes

2. **URL Pattern Changes**
   - Successful first-factor authentication often redirects to a different URL
   - Look for URLs containing terms like: `/mfa`, `/2fa`, `/verify`, `/otp`, `/token`
   - Failed authentication typically stays on the same login page

3. **Response Content Analysis**
   - True 2FA pages contain specific elements:
     - OTP input fields
     - "Enter verification code" messages
     - References to authenticator apps, SMS, or email codes
     - Resend code functionality
   - False positives occur when keywords appear in:
     - JavaScript libraries
     - CSS class names
     - Hidden form elements
     - System metadata

4. **HTTP Response Patterns**
   - Successful first-factor: HTTP 302 redirect or 200 with different content
   - Failed authentication: HTTP 200 with error messages on same page
   - True 2FA: New page/form with verification code input

### Common False Positive Sources
- SharePoint systems often contain "2fa" in file paths and URLs
- JavaScript frameworks may reference MFA in library names
- CSS classes might use MFA-related naming conventions
- System configuration files may mention 2FA capabilities

### Improved Detection Strategy
1. Check for actual form field changes (new OTP input fields)
2. Verify URL changes indicating progression in auth flow
3. Look for specific UI elements (code input, resend buttons)
4. Analyze response structure, not just keyword presence
5. Consider HTTP status codes and redirect patterns
