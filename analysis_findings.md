# Analysis of Stryker Tool 2FA Detection Issue

## Problem Identified
The Stryker tool is incorrectly classifying all login attempts as "2FA_REQUIRED" when they are actually failed login attempts.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Tool's Detection Logic
- Located in `/home/ubuntu/web-ui/server/app.py` line 494-496
- Uses simple keyword matching: `if any(keyword in response.text.lower() for keyword in ["2fa", "two-factor", "mfa", "multi-factor"])`
- This is a very basic heuristic that searches the entire HTML response for these keywords

### Actual Login Page Behavior
- Manual testing shows the real error message: "Wrong User Name/Password or Account Not Activated"
- No 2FA prompts or requirements are actually present
- The page simply returns to the login form with an error message

### Why the False Positive Occurs
- The HTML source code of the login page likely contains references to 2FA/MFA functionality in:
  - JavaScript code
  - CSS classes
  - Hidden form elements
  - Comments or metadata
- These references trigger the keyword matching even though 2FA is not actually being invoked

## Evidence
1. All 6 test attempts returned identical response length (34658 bytes)
2. All attempts stayed on the same URL (login page)
3. Manual testing shows standard login failure behavior
4. No actual 2FA prompts or pages were encountered

## Conclusion
The "2FA_REQUIRED" status is a **FALSE POSITIVE** caused by overly broad keyword matching in the tool's response analysis logic.
